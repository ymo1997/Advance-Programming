The source code contains two files: huffman_tree.h and HuffmanAlgo.c

To compile, please run
	make
To run, please run
	./program

Absolute path is recommended when you use the program.

Possible issue:
After importing a file to generate the huffman code, some characters may not have the corresponding huffman codes, which may cause an encoding failure indication from the program.
